                <h4>Unveiling the craftsmanship: step into the exquisite world of instrument production with Armstrong-Werth, where
                    precision meets passion in every harmonious creation</h4>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>At the inception of its journey toward becoming your personalized companion, your oboe begins as a humble blackwood,
                    thriving in a southern land. Much later, after being felled and segmented, it undergoes a period of stabilization
                    lasting several years — a crucial phase to prevent cracking during subsequent shaping and, ultimately, musical
                    performance.</p>
                <p>As an unrefined block, it enters our production workshop, where it assumes its preliminary form.
                    High-precision machines carve out spaces for the future metal fixtures, housing the valves. Meanwhile, in another
                    workshop, all the hardware is prepared.</p>
                <p>Once the basic wooden framework is ready, it moves to the assembly master,
                    where fixtures are screwed in, and other elements are added. But this is merely the beginning.</p>
                <p>Following the manual
                    adjustment of all metal components, the valves undergo soldering and electroplating (silver or gold coating). The
                    final assembly stage, conducted by the master, involves affixing tempered springs for smooth yet responsive valve
                    action and fitting pads into place.</p>
                <p>The ultimate tuning and refinement of instruments are personally overseen by John
                    and his apprentices, the future of the Armstrong-Werth legacy. It is this final phase of labor that holds paramount
                    importance in shaping the sound of the end product.</p>

            <div>
                <p> John Armstrong is an Australian oboist and oboe maker with a rich history in the music industry. He has worked
                    for reputable companies such as T.W. Howarth in London,
                    the KG reed company in Shanghai, Rigoutat in Paris, Jinyin and Bailicheng in Hebei, China. His extensive
                    experience and dedication to the craft make him a respected div in the world of oboe making.
                    Having started making oboes in 1989, John has since been committed to producing high-quality instruments. In
                    2006, he partnered with oboe maker Tony Ward to create the Armstrong Ward oboe for the Australian market,
                    later rebranded the "KG" oboe in Shanghai. John's continuous dedication to improving oboe manufacturing has led
                    to the development of the Armstrong Werth brand, which aims to provide oboe players with more affordable and
                    rewarding playing experiences through modern manufacturing techniques and quality components.
                    His designs are a reflection of both tradition and the evolving preferences of today's oboists.

                        <dd>A: Your AW oboe comes with a solid 1-year warranty covering both the body and mechanism. Unfortunately, it
                            won't
                            shield against accidental damage, so keep those playing sessions accident-free!</dd>

                        <dt>How should I care for and maintain this instrument to ensure its longevity?</dt>
                        <dd>A: Post-performance TLC is key! After playing, give your oboe a gentle swab or pull-through. For wooden
                            beauties
                            like the Regal, Imperial, and English Horn, show some extra love by lightly oiling the top joint with bore
                            oil every
                            week for the first 2 months. Assemble with a touch of cork grease on the tenons, occasionally hand-polish
                            the
                            mechanism, and rest easy - the mechanism is fully oiled during final assembly. If adjustments are needed
                            during the
                            warranty period, we've got your back - details of a nearby technician and free adjustments if done by an
                            approved
                            technician.</dd>

                        <dt>Are there any recommended accessories or products that should be used with this instrument? </dt>
                        <dd>A: Your AW oboe plays at a cool 442! Pair it with European or USA school reeds. Feeling Euro? Opt for the
                            Chiarugi
                            47mm, type 2. And for cleaning, choose a pull-through with a cord on both ends to avoid those "oops, it's
                            stuck"
                            moments inside the bore!</dd>

                            first 2 weeks, you can return it, no questions asked. And even after that, if something's not quite right
                            during the warranty period, we've got your back - swap it for a shiny new one after confirmation of a fault
                            by an approved technician.</dd>
